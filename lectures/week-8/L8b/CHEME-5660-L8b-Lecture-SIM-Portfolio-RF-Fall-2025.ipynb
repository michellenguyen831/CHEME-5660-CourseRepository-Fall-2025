    "# L8b: Single Index Model Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "In this lecture, we will explore the Single Index Model (SIM) and its application in portfolio optimization. The SIM simplifies the analysis of asset returns by assuming that the returns of individual assets are influenced by a single common factor, typically the market return. Here, we'll look at using single index models to describe portfiolios composed of only risky assets and a combination of risky and risk-free assets.\n",
