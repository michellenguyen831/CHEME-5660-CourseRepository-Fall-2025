The SIM simplifies the analysis of asset returns by assuming that the returns of individual assets are influenced by a single common factor, typically the market return. Here, we'll look at using single index models to describe portfolios composed of only risky assets and a combination of risky and risk-free assets.\n",

    "The Single Index Model (SIM) is a simplified approach to understanding the relationship between the returns of individual assets and the overall market.
