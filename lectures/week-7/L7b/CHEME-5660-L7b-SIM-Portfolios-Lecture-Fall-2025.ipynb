    "Got it—let’s walk it like a story, then land the algebra cleanly.\n",

    "At each time $t$, every asset’s growth rate splits into three pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a constant tilt ($\\alpha_i$),\n",
    "2. a shared shove from the market ($\\beta_i,g_M^{(t)}$),\n",
    "3. a personal wobble ($\\epsilon_i^{(t)}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "So $g_i^{(t)}=\\alpha_i+\\beta_i,g_M^{(t)}+\\epsilon_i^{(t)}$. Covariance measures co-movement. Constants don’t co-move with anything, so $\\alpha_i$ will quietly exit the stage. What’s left is: how much of $g_i$ and $g_j$ move together because they both load on the same market shock, and how much they move together because their idiosyncratic wobbles happen to line up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clean way to formalize that intuition is the law of total covariance—“within-market-state co-movement” plus “co-movement of their market-state means”:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Conditional on $g_M$, the only randomness left is in $\\epsilon_i,\\epsilon_j$. Since constants drop, $\\mathbb{E}[g_i\\mid g_M]=\\alpha_i+\\beta_i g_M$, and $\\mathrm{Cov}(g_i,g_j\\mid g_M)=\\mathrm{Cov}(\\epsilon_i,\\epsilon_j\\mid g_M)$.\n",
    "* If we assume the standard single-index orthogonality $\\mathrm{Cov}(g_M,\\epsilon_i)=0$ (equivalently, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i\\mid g_M]=0$), then the residual covariance does not depend on $g_M$, i.e. $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\epsilon_i,\\epsilon_j\\mid g_M)=\\mathrm{Cov}(\\epsilon_i,\\epsilon_j)$.\n",
