    "# L8b: Single Index Model Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "In this lecture, we will explore the Single Index Model (SIM) and its application in portfolio optimization. The SIM simplifies the analysis of asset returns by assuming that the returns of individual assets are influenced by a single common factor, typically the market return. Here, we'll look at using single index models to describe portfiolios composed of only risky assets and a combination of risky and risk-free assets.\n",

    "## Concept Review: Single Index Model (SIM)\n",
    "The Single Index Model (SIM) is a simplified approach to understanding the relationship between the returns of individual assets and the overall market. It assumes that the return of an asset can be expressed as a linear function of the market return plus a unique component specific to the asset.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Single Index Model (SIM)__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Single index models are factor models that consider only the return (growth) of the market factor. These models were originally developed by Sharpe, 1963: [Sharpe, William F. (1963). \"A Simplified Model for Portfolio Analysis\". Management Science, 9(2): 277-293. doi:10.1287/mnsc.9.2.277.](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.9.2.277)\n",

    "> __Bootstrapping__ The idea is to use our estimated parameters and error model to generate many __synthetic datasets__, then examine the empirical distribution of parameter estimates that we obtain from re-estimating parameters using these datasets. This approach is called __bootstrapping__ because we are _pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps_, i.e., using our fitted model to generate new data and re-estimate parameters, thereby empirically exploring the sampling distribution of our estimator. \n",
