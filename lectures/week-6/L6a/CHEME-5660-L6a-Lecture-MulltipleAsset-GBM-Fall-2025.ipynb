The sign and magnitude of the covariance $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij}$ indicate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between features $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "* _Positive, negative of no relationship?_: The sign of the off-diagonal covariance elements $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij}\\in\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ indicates whether features $i$ and $j$ are positively or negatively correlated, or they are uncorrelated. If $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} > 0$, then features $i$ and $j$ are positively correlated, meaning that as one feature increases, the other feature also tends to increase. If $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} < 0$, then features $i$ and $j$ are negatively correlated, meaning that as one feature increases, the other feature tends to decrease. If $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} = 0$, then features $i$ and $j$ are uncorrelated, meaning that there is no linear relationship between the two features.\n",
    "* _Symmetry_: The covariance matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ is symmetric, meaning that $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} = \\hat{\\Sigma}_{ji}$ for all $i$ and $j$. This is because the covariance between features $i$ and $j$ is the same as the covariance between features $j$ and $i$."
